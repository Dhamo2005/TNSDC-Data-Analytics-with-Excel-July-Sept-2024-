## Course Overview

This repository contains the project submission for the **TNSDC 8-Week Program: Data Analytics with Excel (July-Sept 2024)**. The course is designed to equip participants with essential skills in data analysis using Microsoft Excel. Throughout the course, we explored key concepts such as data visualization, pivot tables, statistical analysis, and advanced Excel functions.

## Project Description

The project focuses on applying the skills learned during the course to a real-world dataset, performing comprehensive data analysis, and presenting actionable insights. This includes:

- **Dataset Preparation**: Cleaning, sorting, and organizing raw data.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating charts, graphs, and pivot tables to visualize data trends.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Using Excel formulas and functions to derive key metrics and summaries.
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Interpreting the results to provide meaningful conclusions and suggestions.

## Key Features
